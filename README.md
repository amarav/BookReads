# MyReads Project

MyReads project is a project that lets you to solidify your knowledge on react fundamentals.
In this project, user lands on a main page with bookshelves with books that are assigned to currently reading, want to read or read. We have the option to switch shelves or search a book and assign it to different shelves.

If the user does not want it to be in any of the shelves , it will set to none. To bring it back to the shelves, user has to navigate to the search page and add it to the shelf or change the shelf

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

    └── index.js # You should not need to modify this file. It is used for DOM rendering only.
    |__ Home.js # Home page displays the bookshelf and a link to search page
    |__ Bookshelf.js #Displays the bookshelf
    |__ DisplayBooks.js #Displays the books in bookshelf 
    |__ ListBook.js  #List the books with their info and options to switch shelves
    |__ Search.js #Search a book and update in bookshelf

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query, maxResults)
```

* query: `<String>`
* maxResults: `<Integer>` Due to the nature of the backend server, search results are capped at 20, even if this is set higher.
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
